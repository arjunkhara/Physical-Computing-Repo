<h1>3D Printing Introduction and Insights</h1>

3D-printing is, incredibly, a primitive technology with far-reaching applications and consequences. A 3D printer is essentially a nozzle-fed device that heats up a filament from about 22°C to 165°C, then outputs the liquid onto a surface bed where it rapidly cools to form the shapes required. Once the shape has cooled it is recommended to leave the item for 10 to 15 minutes before removing it from the 3D printer.

The basic schematics of a 3D printer:

Tinkercad has a 3D printing IDE for outputting basic shapes. However, Cura slicer is the go-to software for Ultimaker projects and machines. Here is the URL to download Cura software, which is provided for free by Ultimaker. OpenScad is another great alternative for 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) projects. Amazingly, Blender and Maya can also support 3D printing plugins to output models.

The following images show:

After designing the final item, Cura provides an estimate of how long the entire printing process will take. In several cases this can be as long as twenty hours. Adjusting the scale and number of layers will adjust the final output time of the item. In the practice project, scaling a keychain from 100% along the X, Y, and Z axes to 30% reduced the print time from 17 hours to about 21 minutes. Scaling in 3D printing adjusts the resolution layer of the final object — it’s particular thickness. All 3D printing files are saved in the GCODE extension. GCODE is the industry standard file extension for 3D printing. For fine-tuning the outputted print item, use a deburrer tool.

Here is an example of my first 3D-CAD drawing on Tinkercad. The object is a keychain overlaid with text - in this case my wife's name. I have also inserted a hole at one corner of the keychain and added a star for greater effect.

Here is the image of my 3D CAD design. I have exported from Tinkercad as an STL file and imported it into Cura and saved it as a GCODE ready file. At this stage the final proof is complete and I have saved the GCODE file onto an SD card and sent it to the Ultima printer. The estimated print time is 12 minutes.

Here is my very first item - a keyring that I created from scratch during my 3D-printing induction. The process fits extremely well with the concepts for 3D modelling and bridges the gap between software and hardware modelling. I realise how similar the two are in terms of approach and process. Planning and vision are identical qualities for both. Here is the link to the image: https://github.com/arjunkhara/3D-modelling-repo/blob/master/Slide18.png
