3D Printing Introduction and Insights

3D-printing is, incredibly, a primitive technology with far-reaching applications and consequences. A 3D printer is essentially a nozzle-fed device that heats up a filament from about 22°C to 165°C, then outputs the liquid onto a surface bed where it rapidly cools to form the shapes required. Once the shape has cooled it is recommended to leave the item for 10 to 15 minutes before removing it from the 3D printer.
