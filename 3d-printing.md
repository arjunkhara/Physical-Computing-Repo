3D Printing Introduction and Insights

3D-printing is, incredibly, a primitive technology with far-reaching applications and consequences. A 3D printer is essentially a nozzle-fed device that heats up a filament from about 22°C to 165°C, then outputs the liquid onto a surface bed where it rapidly cools to form the shapes required. Once the shape has cooled it is recommended to leave the item for 10 to 15 minutes before removing it from the 3D printer.

Tinkercad has a 3D printing IDE for outputting basic shapes. However, Cura slicer is the go-to software for Ultimaker projects and machines. Here is the URL to download Cura software, which is provided for free by Ultimaker. OpenScad is another great alternative for 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) projects. Amazingly, Blender and Maya can also support 3D printing plugins to output models.
