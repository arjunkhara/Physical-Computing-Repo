My physical computing and arduino projects

I’m Arjun. This is my weekly blog for the Physical Computing Module for my MA at Goldsmiths (2017 – 2018). I built this site to document my work, learnings, and insights on a weekly basis spanning this module’s duration. This repository also serves as a learning portal to question and experiment beyond the scope of what the module asks, in order to gain the deepest possible appreciation of physical computing and its evolving role as a companion in our digitally nebulous societies. Once completed, I hope to leave this blog as an active reference for future students of the subject.
