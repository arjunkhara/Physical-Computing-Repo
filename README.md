My physical computing and arduino projects

I’m Arjun. This is my weekly blog for the Physical Computing Module for my MA at Goldsmiths (2017 – 2018). I built this site to document my work, learnings, and insights on a weekly basis spanning this module’s duration. This repository also serves as a learning portal to question and experiment beyond the scope of what the module asks, in order to gain the deepest possible appreciation of physical computing and its evolving role as a companion in our digitally nebulous societies. Once completed, I hope to leave this blog as an active reference for future students of the subject.

Topics 1 through 4 introduce students to the Arduino platform — a circuit board with a micro-controller, capable of integration with both software and hardware. In this respect, the Arduino is a driver of the Internet of Things (IOT), an ecosystem in which connectivity and data-driven decisions extend to physical devices and multi-material computing components. The seemingly simple ability of the board to react to sensors and activate actuators provides an almost limitless array of possibilities across industries, from performance and art to bio-medical and communication applications. In other words, the Arduino is a tangible ambassador of the digital humanities — the confluence of technology, philosophy, form, and function.
